# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

I analyzed life expectancy of male and female around the world found that:

1. Women live longer while men die early.
2. Male and female life expectancies are also strongly correlated such that when women live longer, men also tend to live longer.
3. HongKong is leading with the highest life expectancy.
4. Countries with high life expectancy have a health population.
5. Life expectancy is lower when the birth rate is high.
